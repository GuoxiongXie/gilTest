1) Code in SQL
create two tables sequence_read and sequence_stats
sequence_stats table should have columns sequence_name, sequence_length, percentA, percentC, percentG, percentT, avg_quality
sequence_read table should have columns file_name, sequence_name, chopped_read, chopped_quality
create primary keys for each table
create foreign key between the two tables

2) Code in Bash
unzip fastq files
loop through fastq files and run script fastq_to_fasta_qual.pl on each file
call Perl script below

3) Code in Perl
open each set of fasta/qual files
loop through each sequence read and quality read in corresponding files
trim 15 bases off 3' end of each sequence read and quality read
after trim, exclude reads < 50bp
calculate sequence_length, percentA, percentC, percentG, percentT, and average quality score per read

output:
create text file with sql statements insert into sequence_stats table sequence_name, sequence_length, percentA, percentC, percentG, percentT, avg_quality
insert into sequence_read table file_name, sequence_name, chopped_read, chopped_quality


4) SQL 
create sql statement that will find files with >10 reads that have motif "ACGT" and average quality > 30
